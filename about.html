<!-- INTRO -->
<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-700">Our Mission</h2>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
CareerSteps was founded in 2025 with a simple belief:
<b>No student should feel confused or forced while choosing their career.</b>
</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 mb-10">
In India, millions of students choose Science, Commerce, or Arts due to peer pressure,
lack of guidance, or limited information. CareerSteps exists to change that reality by
providing clear, unbiased, and student-friendly career guidance.
